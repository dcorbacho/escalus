Escalus
=======

Escalus is an Erlang XMPP client library.
It began as a tool for convenient testing of XMPP servers,
but can also be used as a standalone Erlang application.

Escalus is aimed at checking correctness of XMPP server behaviour,
in contrast to tools such as Tsung which are about stress testing
and don't verify correctness.

Quick start
===========

Read the [the intro file](docs/intro.md) to get started.

Standalone Escalus application
==============================

If you're interested in using Escalus as a standalone Erlang XMPP client
library (without any reliance on Common Test),
then see [standalone usage prerequisites](docs/standalone.md).
